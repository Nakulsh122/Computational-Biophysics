Overview

This project processes PDB structures, extracts protein sequences, compares them with FASTA sequences, and calculates molecular weight and accessible surface area (ASA) using NACCESS.

Requirements

Biopython must be installed:

pip install biopython

NACCESS must be available on your system. If it does not run with naccess, provide the full path to the executable.

The code must be run in WSL or Linux.

How to Run

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:

cd /path/to/project

Run the script:

use make file like 
make run : to male the python file 

Enter the required PDB and FASTA IDs in the terminal only followed by an "ENTER" press 
A text will appear when the whole report is generated 

Important Notes

NACCESS Limit: It can only process PDB structures with less than 20,000 atoms.

Valid PDB Files: Use only the PDB indices listed in possible.txt.

Custom NACCESS Path: If needed, update the script with the correct path to NACCESS.

Output

The program generates a report with sequence alignments, chain details, molecular weights, and ASA values.

The report is saved in the project directory.

Troubleshooting

Ensure Biopython is installed.

If NACCESS does not run, check the executable path.

If errors occur with large PDB files, use only those in possible.txt.
